abstract = "Machine learning approaches to medical image synthesis have shown outstanding performance, but often do not convey uncertainty information. In this chapter, we survey uncertainty quantification methods in medical image synthesis and advocate the use of uncertainty for improving clinicians' trust in machine learning solutions. First, we describe basic concepts in uncertainty quantification and discuss its potential benefits in downstream applications. We then review computational strategies that facilitate inference, and identify the main technical and clinical challenges. We provide a first comprehensive review to inform how to quantify, communicate and use uncertainty in medical synthesis applications. "
