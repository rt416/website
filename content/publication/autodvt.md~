abstract = "We propose a dual-task convolutional neural network (CNN) to fully automate the real-time diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT can be reliably diagnosed through evaluation of vascular compressibility at anatomically defined landmarks in streams of ultrasound (US) images. The combined real-time evaluation of these tasks has never been achieved before. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate our approach on two selected landmarks of the femoral vein, which can be identified with high accuracy by our approach. Our CNN is able to identify if a vein fully compresses with a F1 score of more than 90% while applying manual pressure with the ultrasound probe. Fully compressible veins robustly rule out DVT and such patients do not need to be referred to further specialist examination. We have evaluated our method on 1150 5â€“10 s compression image sequences from 115 healthy volunteers, which results in a data set size of approximately 200k labelled images. Our method yields a theoretical inference frame rate of more than 500 fps and we thoroughly evaluate the performance of 15 possible configurations."
