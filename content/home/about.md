Hi! My name is Ryutaro, and Iâ€™m a research scientist at Google DeepMind. 


My research focuses on developing high-performance machine learning algorithms which are risk-aware, interpretable and robust for safe use in healthcare applications. 


Previously, I was in the Healthcare Intelligence group  at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). Before that, I was a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UCL where I was supervised by [Daniel C. Alexander](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/) at CMIC UCL and [Antonio Criminisi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=YHmzvmMAAAAJ&hl=en) at Amazon Cambridge ([my CV](pdf/2022-02-10-ryu_CV_latest.pdf) last updated 12/20/2021).

In the last few years, I have also had the fortune to get involved in startups at different stages of maturity. Between Dec 2016 and May 2018, I worked part-time at [ThinkSono](https://thinksono.com/) as one of the starting members, where I co-developed the prototype of a real-time deep-learning based system for detecting deep vein thrombosis in ultrasound videos. The company was selected by the Bayer accelerator in 2017 as one of the [top 4](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/bayer-2017-grants4apps/) digital health startups out of >450 applications received across the globe. I subsequently spent the summer of 2018 as a research intern at [Butterfly Network](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/09/27/aiming-to-revolutionize-medical-ultrasound-butterfly-raises-250-million-at-a-125-billion-valuation/), a NY-based unicorn that develops an intelligent and portable ultrasound probe. Since April 2019, I have been consulting for [SyntheticGestalt](https://www.syntheticgestalt.com/), a drug discovery startup based in Tokyo.   

**This year, I am co-organising the workshop on [Uncertainty and Safety in Medical Imaging](https://unsuremiccai.github.io/) at MICCAI 2022, Singapore. [Follow us on Twitter for updates :)](https://twitter.com/UNSURE_Workshop)**
