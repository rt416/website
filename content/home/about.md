## **Biography**

I started my PhD in Machine Learning under Microsoft Research Scholarship in Oct 2015. I'm supervised by Daniel C. Alexander at  Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL and Antonio Criminisi at Microsoft Research Cambridge. I am interested in developing machine learning algorithms which are more interpretable and safer to use in the context of medical imaging.

I have also been working as a consultant for [ThinkSono](https://thinksono.com/) since January 2016.
