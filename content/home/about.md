## **Biography**
I’m a Microsoft Research PhD Scholar in the Department of Computer Science, UCL. I’m supervised by [Daniel C. Alexander](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/) of the Centre for Medical Image Computing and [Antonio Criminisi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/antcrim/) of Microsoft Research Cambridge.

I am interested in developing high-performance algorithms which are more interpretable and safer to use in medical applications. I also hold passion for designing methods that can cheaply and reliably enhance the quality of medical image data. Our paper on [Bayesian super-resolution](https://rt416.github.io/publication/biqt-rf/) proposes a method based on probabilistic CNN for enhancing dMR images while providing a reliability metric. 

I have also had the fortune to work as a technical consultant since January 2016 for a London based start-up, [ThinkSono](https://thinksono.com/), which aims to develop a diagnostic software for detection of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).
