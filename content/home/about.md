I’m a final year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UCL. I’m supervised by [Daniel C. Alexander](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/) at CMIC UCL and [Antonio Criminisi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=YHmzvmMAAAAJ&hl=en) at Amazon Cambridge. My PhD is funded by [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).

My research focuses on developing high-performance machine learning algorithms which are risk-aware, interpretable and robust for safe use in medical applications. 

During my Phd, I have had the fortune to get involved in startups at different stages of maturity. Between Dec 2016 and May 2018, I worked part-time at [ThinkSono](https://thinksono.com/) as one of the starting members, where I co-developed the prototype of a real-time deep-learning based system for detecting deep vein thrombosis in ultrasound videos. The company was selected by the Bayer accelerator in 2017 as one of the [top 4](https://www.bayer.co.uk/en/media/latest-news/bayer-welcomes-new-digital-health-talents-in-2017-grants4apps-accelerator-program-in-berlin.php) digital health startups out of >450 applications received across the globe. I subsequently spent the summer of 2018 as a research intern at [Butterfly Network](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/09/27/aiming-to-revolutionize-medical-ultrasound-butterfly-raises-250-million-at-a-125-billion-valuation/), a NY-based unicorn that develops an intelligent and portable ultrasound probe. Since April 2019, I have been consulting for [SyntheticGestalt](https://www.syntheticgestalt.com/), a drug discovery startup based in Tokyo.   

**This year, I am co-organising the workshop on [Uncertainty and Safety in Medical Imaging](https://unsure.miccai.ethz.ch/) at MICCAI 2019, Shenzhen, China.**
